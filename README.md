**Shop-Shop** is an ecommerce site refactored to use **Redux** instead of **Context API** to manage *global state*. 

<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

    - [x] THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
    - [x] THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
    - [x] THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
    - [x] THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
